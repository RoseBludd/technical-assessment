# Key Decisions Documentation

This document outlines key architectural and design decisions made in the project to ensure maintainability, scalability, and consistency.

## UI Component Library: ShadCN

**Decision:** We chose [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) as our UI component library

### Why ShadCN?

- **Customizable**: Provides unstyled components, allowing full control over styling.
- **TailwindCSS Integration**: Ensures a consistent and scalable design system.
- **Lightweight**: Reduces dependencies on external updates by installing components locally.
- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility best practices.

### Implications

- Components can be easily modified per project requirements.
- Requires manual updates when needed.
- Encourages structured styling using TailwindCSS utilities.

## Component Architecture: Atomic Design

**Decision:** We structured our UI components using the **Atomic Design** methodology.

### Why Atomic Design?

- **Scalability**: Allows easy extension and modification without breaking the UI.
- **Reusability**: Promotes reuse of smaller components in larger UI pieces.
- **Maintainability**: Keeps the project well-organized by categorizing components into clear layers.

### Component Structure

```
/components
  ├── atoms/        # Smallest UI elements (buttons, inputs, icons, etc.)
  ├── molecules/    # Combinations of atoms (form fields, dropdowns, etc.)
  ├── organisms/    # Groups of molecules forming sections (navbar, cards, etc.)
  ├── templates/    # Page-level layouts with placeholders
  ├── pages/        # Final pages composed of templates and components
```

### Implications

- Encourages a **structured approach** to UI development.
- Enhances **code reusability** and **consistency** across the project.
- Requires **strict adherence** to maintain clarity.

## Future Considerations

- **Component Updates:** Establish a process for managing and updating ShadCN components.
- **Testing Strategy:** Implement unit and integration tests for atomic components.
- **Theming & Customization:** Ensure a scalable approach for modifying styles and themes without major refactoring.
